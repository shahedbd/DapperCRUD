# Dapper CRUD
ASP.NET MVC CRUD Operation using Dapper Micro ORM


Dapper is a light-weight ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool, which helps the developers to map their database with POCO <br /> 
(Plain Old CLR Object) /MODEL. Dapper is free and open source. Dapper was developed by Sam Saffron, Marc Gravell, and Nick Craver. <br /> 

If you are willing to write the SQL Query and take the taste of ORM, then Dapper is a good choice for you. Dapper makes it very easy to <br /> 
handle all kinds of database operations. <br />
